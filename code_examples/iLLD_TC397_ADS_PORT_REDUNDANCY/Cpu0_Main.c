 /*\title Port redundancy safety mechanism
 * \abstract This code example presents the implementation of port redundancy safety mechanism
 * \description The scope of this code example is to understand how to implement a software based port redundancy
 *              safety mechanism (SM). The application software (SW) shall configure and use redundant General Purpose
 *              Input Output (GPIO) to detect faults when receiving or transmitting the information.
