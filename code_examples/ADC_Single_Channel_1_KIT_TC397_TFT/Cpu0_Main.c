 /*\title ADC single channel conversion
 * \abstract The Enhanced Versatile Analog-to-Digital Converter (EVADC) is configured to measure an analog signal using queued request.
 * \description An analog input channel is continuously converted using the queued mode.
 *              The input value is determined using the microcontrollerâ€™s supply voltage, ground level or letting
 *              the analog pin open and floating. Three LEDs are used, each indicating a voltage interval.
 *              Thus depending on the conversion value, a certain LED will light up.
