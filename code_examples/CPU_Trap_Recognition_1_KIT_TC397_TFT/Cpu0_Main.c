 /*\title TRAP error recognition and reaction
 * \abstract This example shows how to identify the root cause of a trap.
 * \description The tutorial describes what types of traps are supported by the AURIX microcontroller, their root
 *              causes and how to identify them. AURIX architecture supports different types of traps. Three different
 *              traps can be provoked with this example and the tutorial guides the user through the needed steps to
 *              observe the root cause of each trap.
