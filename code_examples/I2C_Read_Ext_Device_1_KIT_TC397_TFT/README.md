# I2C_Read_Ext_Device_1_KIT_TC397_TFT
An I2C module configured as I2C master is used to read a register of an external device.

## Device  
The device used in this example is AURIX&trade; TC39xTP_A-Step.

## Board  
The board used for testing is the AURIX&trade; TC397 TFT (KIT_A2G_TC397_5V_TFT).

## Scope of work  
An I2C module configured as I2C master is used to read the MAC address stored in MCP79411, a Real-Time-Clock device mounted on the board KIT_A2G_TC397_5V_TFT. The AURIX&trade; device reads the MAC address through the I2C module and stores it into a global variable.  

## Introduction  
The I2C protocol was developed to provide a simple and efficient data transfer between multiple devices over a short distance.

It uses a bidirectional serial bus with two wires. A serial data line (SDA) and a serial clock line (SCL) are carrying the information between multiple devices.

Both lines are connected to a positive supply voltage via pull-up resistors.

An I2C device can work as a master or as a slave. The master, which is normally a microcontroller, initiates and terminates the transfer and generates the clock pulse.

A specific slave can be addressed by the master via a 7- or 10-bit address. Afterwards the master starts the communication:
- Data can flow in either direction and can be set via a data direction bit, which is transmitted by the master

## Hardware setup  
This code example has been developed for the board KIT_A2G_TC397_5V_TFT.

The MCP79411 chip is mounted on the board and connected via the I2C bus to the microcontroller. 

The used data lines are connected to the positive power supply via two pull-up resistors.

The MCP79411 is a battery-backed I2C Real-Time Clock/Calendar (RTCC) device with SRAM, EEPROM and protected EEPROM.

## Implementation  

### Configuring the I2C communication 
The configuration of the I2C communication is done once in the setup phase in two different steps: 
- The initialization of the I2C module by initializing an instance of the *IfxI2c_I2c_Config* structure
- The initialization of every device that is connected to the I2C module (in this case, the MCP79411 chip) by initializing an instance of the *IfxI2c_I2c_deviceConfig* structure for each device

### Configuring the I2C module
The function *IfxI2c_I2c_initConfig()* initializes an instance of the structure *IfxI2c_I2c_Config* with its default values.

The *IfxI2c_I2c_Config* structure allows setting the parameters to initialize the module:
- baudrate – to set the clock speed in bit/s. Typical values are 100 kbit/s in standard mode, 400 kbit/s in fast mode and 3.4 Mbit/s in high-speed mode
- pins – a structure to set the port pins used for the communication. A serial data line (SDA) and a serial clock line (SCL) carry the information between the devices, therefore two port pins are required

The function *IfxI2c_I2c_initModule()* initializes and activates the I2C module with the user configuration in master mode.
The functions above are provided by the iLLD header *IfxI2c_I2c.h*.

### Configuring the I2C device
The function *IfxI2c_I2c_initDeviceConfig()* initializes an instance of the structure *IfxI2c_I2c_deviceConfig* with its default values.

Afterwards, the 7-bit slave address can be set through the parameter *deviceAddress*.

The function *IfxI2c_I2c_initDevice()* finalizes the I2C initialization by connecting the device configuration with the preconfigured I2C module.

The functions above are provided by the iLLD header *IfxI2c_I2c.h*.

### Establish I2C communication
Data transfer between the external device and the microcontroller is divided into two steps:
- Firstly, the microcontroller is transmitting the address of the register, in which the requested data is stored on the external device (the register containing the MAC address of MCP79411 is 0xF2). This is done using the *IfxI2c_I2c_write()* function
- Then, the reading of the MAC address is started with the function *IfxI2c_I2c_read()*

Both the write and read functions are defined in the iLLD header *IfxI2c_I2c.h*.

## Compiling and programming  
Before testing this code example:  
- Power the board through the dedicated power connector
- Connect the board to the PC through the USB interface  
- Build the project using the dedicated Build button <img src="./Images/build_activeproj.gif" /> or by right-clicking the project name and selecting "Build Project"  
- To flash the device and immediately run the program, click on the dedicated Flash button <img src="./Images/Widget_Flash.png" width="16"/>

## Run and Test
After code compilation and flashing the device, perform the following steps:
- Use the debugger to watch the hexadecimal value of the global array *g_macAddr*.

**Note**: The MAC address is unique for each board.

A second test can be performed with an oscilloscope. Two oscilloscope probes can be connected to SDA and SCL pins to observe the generated and received signals.

<img src="./Images/UsedPins.png" width="200" />  

The following waveforms should be seen on the oscilloscope after pressing the PORST push button:
- First data section: device address byte and register address
- Second data section: device address byte and six bytes of data (Please refer to the next slide for more details about the data sections)

<img src="./Images/SDA_SCL.png" width="600" />  

First data section: To perform a read operation, the master addresses the slave (transmitting the device address (0x57) with the Read/Write bit set to „write“) and sends the requested register to read (transmitting 0xF2 afterwards)

Second data section : The reading process is started by transmitting the device address (0x57) and setting Read/Write bit to „read“; six bytes from the RTCC device, containing the MAC address, are then received
