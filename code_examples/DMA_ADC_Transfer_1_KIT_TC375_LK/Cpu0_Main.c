 /*\title DMA transfer of ADC conversion results
 * \abstract The DMA is used to transfer ADC measurements results to CPU0 DSPR.
 * \description At the end of an analog-to-digital conversion of the Enhanced Versatile Analog-to-Digital Converter
 *              (EVADC) module, an interrupt is triggered, which starts the data transfer of the converted ADC results
 *              via DMA to the CPU0 Data Scratch-Pad SRAM (DSPR0). The ADC conversion is started manually via a
 *              command of a serial monitor.
