 /*\title PWM input capturing via TIM
 * \abstract The Timer Input Module (TIM) of the GTM is used to capture an external PWM signal and calculate the PWM signal frequency and duty cycle.
 * \description The TIM is used in capture mode. The data from the captured PWM signal is used to calculate the
 *              PWM signal frequency and duty cycle in software. The frequency and the duty cycle are then stored
 *              in variables.
