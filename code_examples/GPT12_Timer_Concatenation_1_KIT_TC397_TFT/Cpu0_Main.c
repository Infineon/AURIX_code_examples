 /*\title Timer concatenation of GPT12
 * \abstract A 32-bit timer is formed by the concatenation of two timers of the GPT12 module. On timer overflow an interrupt is generated, which toggles an LED.
 * \description A 32-bit timer is formed by the concatenation of two 16-bit timers of the GPT12 module.
 *              When the 32-bit timer overflows, an interrupt is generated toggling an LED.
