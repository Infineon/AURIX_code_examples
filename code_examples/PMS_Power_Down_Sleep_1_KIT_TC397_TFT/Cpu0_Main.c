 /*\title Power Saving in Sleep Mode
 * \abstract The system is set into sleep mode and it is waken up by the System Timer Module (STM) every 2 seconds.
 * \description An STM timer generates an interrupt on the CPU0 every two seconds, switching the AURIX device from
 *              run mode to sleep mode and vice versa. A GTM timer, responsible for toggling an LED, is then allowed to
 *              go into sleep mode, thus stopping the LED from blinking. Two seconds later, the board is switched back
 *              into run mode and the LED blinks again.
