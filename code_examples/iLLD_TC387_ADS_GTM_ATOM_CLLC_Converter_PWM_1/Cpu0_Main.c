 /*\title CLLC DC-DC PWM Generation
 * \abstract The GTM ATOM is configured to generate a PWM signals for CLLC DC-DC converter.
 * \description This example is intended to show, how to configure the iLLD framework (GTM ATOM) to generate PWM signals
 *              for CLLC DC-DC converter.
 *              The states of the 8 pins are controlled by the PWM signals generated by the Generic Timer Module (GTM)
 *              in-built ARU-Connected Timer Output Module (ATOM). All signals are synchronous to each other, edge aligned,
 *              phase shifted and with dead times (positive/negative) for the complementary pairs.
