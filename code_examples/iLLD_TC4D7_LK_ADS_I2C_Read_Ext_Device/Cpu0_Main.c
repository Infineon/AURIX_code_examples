 /*\title I2C_Read_Ext_Device
 * \abstract An I2C module configured as I2C master is used to read a register of an external device.
 * \description An I2C module configured as I2C master is used to read the MAC address stored in the Microchip 2K I2C Serial EEPROM mounted on the board KIT_A3G_TC4D7_LITE. The AURIX&trade; device reads the MAC address through the I2C module and stores it into a global variable.
