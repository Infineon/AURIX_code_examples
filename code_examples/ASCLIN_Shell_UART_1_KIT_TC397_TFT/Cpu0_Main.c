 /*\title Shell via UART communication
 * \abstract A Shell is used to parse a command line and call the corresponding command execution. The ASCLIN module is used to interface with the Shell through the USB port via UART.
 * \description The ASCLIN module is configured for UART communication.
 *              The Shell from iLLDs exploits the ASCLIN module to interpret and manage commands from the
 *              user like "info", "toggle [x]" or "help".
