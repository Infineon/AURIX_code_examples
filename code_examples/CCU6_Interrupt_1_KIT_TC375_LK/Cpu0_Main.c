 /*\title CCU6 interrupt generation
 * \abstract The CCU6 unit generates an interrupt every 500 ms and increments a counter in its Interrupt Service Routine (ISR).
 * \description Timer T12 of the CCU6 unit generates an interrupt on a "period match" event every 500 ms.
 *              Inside the ISR, a counter variable is incremented.
 *              The LEDs toggle based on the value of the counter:
 *              - LED1 on and LED2 off: counter % 2 == 0
 *              - LED1 off and LED2 on: counter % 2 == 1
