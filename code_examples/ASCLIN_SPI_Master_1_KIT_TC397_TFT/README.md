# ASCLIN_SPI_Master_1_KIT_TC397_TFT
An ASCLIN module configured as SPI master sends a two bytes message.

## Device  
The device used in this example is AURIX&trade; TC39xTP_A-Step.

## Board  
The board used for testing is the AURIX&trade; TC397 TFT (KIT_A2G_TC397_5V_TFT).

## Scope of work  
The two bytes message is sent through MTSR (MOSI) port pin P15.4 in loopback mode. This signal can be visualized on the oscilloscope screen.

## Introduction  
The Asynchronous/Synchronous Interface (ASCLIN) module provides synchronous serial communication like SPI with external devices, using data-in and data-out signals only.

The ASCLIN module in SPI configuration can support master mode only with four-wire or three-wire (without slave select output signal) and up to 16-bit data width.

## Hardware setup  
This code example has been developed for the board KIT_A2G_TC397_5V_TFT.

The port pin P15.4 (SPI-MTSR) should be connected to the port pin P15.5 (SPI-MRST) in order to form an internal loopback.  
Those pins can also be connected to an oscilloscope probe for observing the SPI signal.

## Implementation  

### Configure the ASCLIN module
Configuration of the ASCLIN module for SPI communication is done in the setup phase by initializing an instance of the *IfxAsclin_Spi_Config* structure with the following parameters:
- *baudrate* – structure to set the actual communication speed in bit/s
- *interrupt* – structure to set: 
  - transmit and receive interrupt priorities (*txPriority*, *rxPriority*)
  - *typeOfService* – defines which service provider is responsible for handling the interrupt, which can be any of the available CPUs, or the DMA 
- *pins* – structure to set which GPIO port pins are used for the communication

The function *IfxAsclin_Spi_initModuleConfig()* fills the configuration structure with default values and *IfxAsclin_Spi_initModule()* initializes the module with the user configuration.

All the above functions can be found in the iLLD header *IfxAsclin_Spi.h*.

### The SPI message exchange function
The data-out (MTSR/MOSI) is connected via internal loopback to the data-in (MRST/MISO).

The two bytes message is sent via the function *exchange_ASCLIN_SPI_message()* which is called once after initialization of the ASCLIN module.

The two bytes message is sent from the *g_spiTxBuffer* to the *g_spiRxBuffer* using the function *IfxAsclin_Spi_exchange()* from the *IfxAsclin_Spi.h* header file.

## Compiling and programming  
Before testing this code example:  
- Power the board through the dedicated power connector
- Connect the board to the PC through the USB interface  
- Build the project using the dedicated Build button <img src="./Images/build_activeproj.gif" /> or by right-clicking the project name and selecting "Build Project"  
- To flash the device and immediately run the program, click on the dedicated Flash button <img src="./Images/Widget_Flash.png" width="16"/>

## Run and Test
After code compilation and flashing the device, perform the following steps:
› Connect the oscilloscope probe to the MTSR pin (P15.4) 
› Reset and run the program by pressing the PORST push button
› Check the oscilloscope for the SPI signal:

An additional test without using an oscilloscope can be performed with the debugger:
- Before transmission, the buffer *g_spiTxBuffer* is filled with a two bytes message and the buffer *g_spiRxBuffer* is empty
- After transmission, both buffers should hold the same message:
  - By using the debugger, you can watch the content of both buffers before and after transmission by setting a breakpoint to *exchange_ASCLIN_SPI_message()*
  - When reaching this breakpoint, check the content of both buffers (it should be different)
  - After stepping over this function, the content of the buffers must be equal
