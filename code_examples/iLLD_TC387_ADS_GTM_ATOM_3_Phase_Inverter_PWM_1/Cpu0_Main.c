 /*\title GTM ATOM 3-Phase Inverter PWM generation
 * \abstract The GTM ATOM is configured to generate a PWM signals for two-level three phase inverter.
 * \description The states of the 6 pins are controlled by the PWM signals generated by the Generic Timer
 *              Module (GTM) in-built ARU-Connected Timer Output Module (ATOM). All signals are synchronous to each
 *              other, center-aligned and with dead-times (positive/negative) for the complementary pairs.
