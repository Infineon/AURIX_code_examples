 /*\title SPI communication via QSPI
 * \abstract A QSPI module configured as SPI master sends five bytes to another QSPI module which is configured as SPI slave.
 * \description QSPI1 is configured in master mode and used to send five bytes to QSPI2 configured in slave mode.
 *              The received data is read by the CPU and compared against the transmitted data. Port pin 00.5,
 *              to which LED1 is connected, indicates the successful transfer.
