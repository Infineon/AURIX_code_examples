 /*\title MULTICAN in GATEWAY mode using TX FIFO
 * \abstract MULTICAN in Gateway mode is used to exchange data using a gateway with a TX FIFO structure between multiple nodes, implemented in the same device using Loop-Back mode.
 * \description The CAN messages are sent from CAN node 2 over CAN bus (in case of Loop-Back
 *              mode all nodes can access the internal bus). CAN node 0 receives the transmitted
 *              messages but also immediately gateways the received data to CAN node 1. Three
 *              message objects allocated to CAN node 1 define a TX FIFO buffer structure.
 *              Immediately, upon the reception of the data via gateway, CAN node 1 transmits
 *              the received data. The data transmitted by the CAN node 1 is received by the CAN
 *              node 3. The content of the received data will be compared to the content of the
 *              transmitted CAN messages together with the FIFO status check and in case of success,
 *              a LED is turned on to confirm successful message reception.
