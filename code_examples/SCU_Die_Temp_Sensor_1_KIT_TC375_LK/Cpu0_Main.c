 /*\title Die Temperature Sensor
 * \abstract The die temperature is measured by an internal sensor and printed on a terminal program
 * \description The internal Die Temperature Sensor (DTS) is continuously read in an infinite loop.
 *              When a new temperature result is available an interrupt service routine (ISR) is triggered.
 *              The ISR notifies the availability of a new die temperature value by setting a flag,
 *              which is used to start printing the temperature via UART communication using the
 *              ASCLIN module. The temperature value can be read by using a terminal program
 *              connected to the virtual COM port of the board/kit.
