# STM_Interrupt_1_KIT_TC397_TFT
The STM is configured to trigger an interrupt every 500 ms. The interrupt toggles an LED.

## Device  
The device used in this example is AURIX&trade; TC39xTP_A-Step.

## Board  
The board used for testing is the AURIX&trade; TC397 TFT (KIT_A2G_TC397_5V_TFT).

## Scope of work  
The System Timer (STM) module counts up to a configured compare value, when it reaches the specific value, it triggers an interrupt and resets its counter value. The value is set to trigger the interrupt every 500 ms; at each interrupt an LED is toggled.

## Introduction  
The System Timer (STM) is a free running 64-bit counter that can be used for timing applications requiring both high precision and long period.

Among other features, the STM has the capability to generate interrupts when its counter reaches a predefined compare value.

The comparison is flexible in terms of bit sets. Any of the 64 bits of the STM can be selected for comparison.

## Hardware setup  
This code example has been developed for the board KIT_A2G_TC397_5V_TFT.

## Implementation  

### Configure and control the LED
The LED is toggled by controlling the port pin to which it is connected using functions from the iLLD header *IfxPort.h*.

Inside the function *initPeripherals()*, the port pin is configured to push-pull output mode using the function *IfxPort_setPinMode()*.

During program execution, inside the interrupt service routine *isrSTM()*, the LED is switched on and off using the function *IfxPort_setPinState()*.

### Configure the STM
Configuration of the STM is done inside the function *initSTM()* by initializing an instance of the *IfxStm_CompareConfig* structure with default values through the function *IfxStm_initCompareConfig()*. 

The following parameters are modified:
- *ticks* – the total amount of ticks to count before the interrupt generation
- *triggerPriority* – priority of the interrupt generated by the STM on compare match. It can be a value from 0 to 255, with 0 meaning interrupt is disabled and 255 is the highest priority
- *typeOfService* – to define which service provider is responsible for handling the interrupt. This can be any of the available CPUs or the DMA

The configuration is then applied to the STM via the function *IfxStm_initCompare()*.

The above functions can be found in the iLLD header *IfxStm.h*.

### Configure the Interrupt Service Routine
The function implementing the ISR (*isrSTM()*) needs to be assigned a priority. 
This is done with the macro *IFX_INTERRUPT(isr, vectabNum, priority)*.

When triggered, the ISR:
- Instructs the STM to raise the next interrupt after a certain amount of time by updating its compare register with the function *IfxStm_increaseCompare()*
- Toggles the LED by changing the state of the port pin using the function *IfxPort_setPinState()*

## Compiling and programming  
Before testing this code example:  
- Power the board through the dedicated power connector
- Connect the board to the PC through the USB interface  
- Build the project using the dedicated Build button <img src="./Images/build_activeproj.gif" /> or by right-clicking the project name and selecting "Build Project"  
- To flash the device and immediately run the program, click on the dedicated Flash button <img src="./Images/Widget_Flash.png" width="16"/>

## Run and Test
After code compilation and flashing the device, observe the LED D107 (1), which should be blinking.
