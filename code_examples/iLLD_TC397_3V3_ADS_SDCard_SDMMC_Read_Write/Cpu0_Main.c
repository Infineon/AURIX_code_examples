 /*\title SDCard multiblock Read Write with SDMMC_
 * \abstract Write and read a text file in an SD_Card connected to the SDMMC peripheral.
 * \description The SDMMC is initialized in 4 bit configuration with SDMA mode.
 *              Using the FatFs file system the SDCard is mounted and a message is written into text file "Message.txt" (the file is created if inexistent).
 *              The text file is then read and the message is displayed on the serial terminal.
