 /*\title Flash programming
 * \abstract This example shows how to flash the Program Flash memory and the Data Flash memory.
 * \description In this example, 64 Bytes of the Program Flash memory (PFLASH) are flashed and verified afterwards.
 *              Furthermore, 64 Bytes of the Data Flash memory (DFLASH) are flashed and verified. Before any write
 *              operation, the flash memories are erased. If the flash operation is successful, an LED for each tested
 *              memory is turned ON.
