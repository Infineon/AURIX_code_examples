 /*\title BMETAL_TC387_ADS_EDSADC_FIFO_1
 * \abstract Bare metal code example to initialize TC387 EDSADC, its FIFO, interrupt and FIFO read.
 * \description This bare metal code example initializes TC387 EDSADC and its FIFO.
 *              Every time when the FIFO is full (with 4 results in single-word read mode, DRM = 0), an interrupt is triggered and results are fetched from FIFO.
 *              A 100ns wait is inserted between each read (the first read after interrupt does not need wait). See user manual chapter "Result Service Request Generation and Read Sequencing" foot note.
 *              Corresponding FIFO error bits are checked when reading results, in order to ensure data integrity.
