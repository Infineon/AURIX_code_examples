/*\title iLLD_TC375_ADS_OVERLAY_LITEKIT
 * \abstract The data access overlay (OVC) provides the capability to redirect selected data accesses to the Overlay memory.
 * \description The data overlay functionality provides the possibility of redirecting data read access from a non-volatile
                memory (Target Memory/Code Memory) to a volatile memory (Overlay Memory) for execution. The process usually
                involves copying code from a (non-volatile/Code Memory) to volatile memory, that makes it possible, for
                example, to modify program parameters (which are typically stored in the code memory) during run time of
                program. Once copied, an overlay mechanism is instituted (configure required Overlay Control registers).
                The registers are prepared to enable/disable the redirection from non-volatile memory (usually Flash)
                into volatile memory (SRAM). The CPU convert the addresses to access the volatile memory (SRAM) instead the
                non-volatile memory (Flash). Once the redirecting process has been completed, the modified parameters that
                are in the volatile memory will be stored back to the non-volatile memory (which is not addressed in the
                provided code example). Different test scenarios has been provided in this code example, focused on ensuring
                that the redirection of memory accesses is accurately configured.
