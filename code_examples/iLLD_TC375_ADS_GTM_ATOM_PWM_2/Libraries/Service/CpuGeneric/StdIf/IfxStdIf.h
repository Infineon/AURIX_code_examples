 * Term                      |  Description
 * ------------------------- | -------
 * Standard Interface        | Interface defined in this document
 * Interface Driver          | Specific device driver as defined by the iLLD
 * Standard Interface Driver | Specific interface driver which implements the Standard Interface
 * API used at runtime       | API that are used after initialization
 * Module                    | Hardware functional block / IP
 *
 * \par Overview
 * The Standard Interface provides generic runtime API written in C for common use case application. It abstracts the underlaying Interface Driver,
 * i.e. the runtime API is completely device independent. It provides generic API for common use case application.
 *
 * Example of Standard Interface:
 * - Serial communication interface
 * - PWM interface
 * - Position sensor interface
 * - Timer interface
 * - EEPROM interface
 *
 * The target is to be able to exchange the microcontroller or external connected devices on which the application is based with a minimal impact
 *  on the application code, to reduce the application software development and maintenance effort.  This is archived by the Standard Interface,
 * for which, changing the hardware only requires the update of the device configuration settings and the device initialization code. The API used
 * at runtime, which represents the majority and the complexitity of the related code keep unchanged.
 *
 * Motivation: because the current software developed for the automotive applications mainly don’t use C++, the Standard Interface provides a common
 *  definition for the device driver and an alternative layer for different hardware instead of using C++ interface wrapper class.
 *
 *
 * The below figure shows the layers used and an example of APIs used by the application.

 *
 * The Standard Interface is implemented by Standard Interface wrapper by providing the function pointer to the custom functions. This gives
 * the possibility to the programmer to use it or not. When used, it increases the code portability but slightly decreases the performance in
 * term of run time execution and code size. When not used, the performance is not affected.
 *
 *
 * \par Definition
 * The standard interface requires the definition of at least two components: the standard interface component and the standard interface wrapper
 * component. The standard interface component defines for each standard interface a standard interface object and a set of standard APIs used at
 * runtime by the application. The standard interface wrapper component initializes the standard interface component by linking it to the interface
 * driver.
 *
 * \attention:  The application shall explicitly use the API provided by the standard interface component at runtime to access driver’s parameters
 * (setter/ getter) or action (methods). Trying to access members of the standard interface component directly though the object may not guaranty
 * future code compatibility. The same applies to the interface driver (reminder).
 *
 *
 * \par Convention
 *
 * The Standard interface defines the following files:
 * Path/File                                       | Description
