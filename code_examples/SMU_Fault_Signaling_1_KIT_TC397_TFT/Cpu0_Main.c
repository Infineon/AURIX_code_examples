 /*\title Fault signaling via a port pin
 * \abstract The Fault Signaling Protocol (FSP) pin is configured by the SMU to signal a fault by changing the state of the port pin P33.8.
 * \description During initialization the FSP is set to fault free state, indicated by a high level of the port pin
 *              P33.8. The software triggers an alarm that leads to the FSP fault state, thus the port pin P33.8
 *              switches to low level state. After one second from triggering the alarm, the FSP release command
 *              is sent by software. The port pin P33.8 state switches to high level after the command is sent.
