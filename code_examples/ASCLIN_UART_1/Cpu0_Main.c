 /*\title UART communication via ASCLIN module
 * \abstract An ASCLIN module configured for UART communication sends "Hello World!" and receives the string via the internal loopback.
 * \description The string "Hello World!" is sent and received via UART through one pin due to the internal loopback.
 *              The data can be visualized using an oscilloscope.
