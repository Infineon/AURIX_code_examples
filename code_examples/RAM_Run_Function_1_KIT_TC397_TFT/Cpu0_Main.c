 /*\title Function running from RAM
 * \abstract A function is stored and executed from SRAM.
 * \description This example implements twice the same function which toggles an LED with a wait loop.
 *              One function is implemented to be executed from SRAM and the other one from Flash memory.
 *              The SRAM function is toggling LED1 (P13.0), while the flash function is toggling LED2 (P13.1).
