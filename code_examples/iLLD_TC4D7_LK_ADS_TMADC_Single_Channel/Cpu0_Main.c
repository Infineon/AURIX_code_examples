 /*\title TMADC Single Channel
 * \abstract The TMADC is configured to continuously measure an analog signal, generating an interrupt request when a result is available.
 * \description An analog input channel of Time-Multiplexed Analog-to-Digital Converter (TMADC) will be continuously converted.
 *              When a result is available, an interrupt service request is generated.
 *              The input value can be determined by the on-board potentiometer (R32) which is connected to AN0 pin.
 *              Two LEDs are used to indicate a voltage interval, thus depending on the conversion value, one or both LEDs are on.
