 /*\title LED controlled via a push button
 * \abstract An LED is controlled via a push button.
 * \description Upon pressure of a push button, an LED is turned on and the LED is turned off when
 *              releasing the button. One port pin is configured as input for checking the push button
 *              state and the other port pin is configured as output to control the LED.
 *              Short the port pins P14.4 with P14.5 (pin 39 and 40 of header X102) to switch on the LED D110.
