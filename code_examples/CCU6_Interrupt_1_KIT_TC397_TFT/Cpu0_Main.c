 /*\title CCU6 interrupt generation
 * \abstract The CCU6 unit generates an interrupt every 500 ms and increments a counter in its Interrupt Service Routine (ISR).
 * \description Timer T12 of the CCU6  unit generates an interrupt on a "period match" event every 500 ms.
 *              Inside the ISR, a counter variable is incremented.
 *              LEDs toggles based on the value of the counter:
 *              - 1st LED: counter % 4 == 0
 *              - 2nd LED: counter % 4 == 1
 *              - 3rd LED: counter % 4 == 2
 *              - 4th LED: counter % 4 == 3
