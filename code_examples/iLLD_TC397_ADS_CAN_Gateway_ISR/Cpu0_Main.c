 /*\title iLLD_TC397_ADS_CAN_Gateway_ISR
 * \abstract This example shows how to use the ISR for routing CAN frame received on one bus to another bus
 * \description Some applications require an automatic CAN frames re-routing between two different CAN busses without CPU interaction.
 *              Such a "gateway" feature is not available in MCMCAN module of TC3xx family devices.
 *              This example shows how to implement a "SW gatewayâ€œ for routing CAN frame by using the ISR (Interrupt service routine).
 *              
 *              CAN0 (CAN0 node0) is configured as "gateway source" and CAN1 (CAN1 node0) as "gateway destination".
 *              The defined messages restored in the RxFIFO on the "gateway source" will be rerouted to "gateway destination" by using the ISR.
 *              In order to avoid message losing due to CPU latency the RxFIFO is configured on the source node; while TxFIFO is configured on
 *              the destination node in order to avoid delayed transmission due to higher load on the destination bus.
