 /*\title DMA transfer of ADC conversion results
 * \abstract The DMA is used to transfer ADC measurements results to LMURAM.
 * \description At the end of an analog-to-digital conversion of the Enhanced Versatile Analog-to-Digital
 *              Converter (EVADC) module, an interrupt is triggered, which starts the data transfer of the converted
 *              ADC results via DMA to the LMURAM. The ADC conversion is started manually via a command of a serial
 *              monitor.
