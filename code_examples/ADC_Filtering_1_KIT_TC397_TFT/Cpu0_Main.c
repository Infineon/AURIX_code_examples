 /*\title ADC filtering
 * \abstract Four EVADC channels are used to convert the same analog signal with different filters enabled.
 * \description The Enhanced Versatile Analog-to-Digital Converter (EVADC) module is configured to convert four
 *              channels. The data resulting from the conversions of three channels is automatically modified: one
 *              channel computes an average on 4 results, another channel applies a 3rd order Finite Impulse
 *              Response (FIR) filter and another channel applies a 1st order Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) filter.
 *              Finally, the last channel measures the same signal without Data Modification.
 *              The channels are continuously converted and, for each of them, the maximum and minimum
 *              values are stored, which are then sent through UART in order to be compared.
