 /*\title External interrupt generation
 * \abstract The ERU is used to generate an interrupt on each rising and falling edge at an input pin.
 * \description The code example uses the External Request Unit (ERU) to generate an interrupt for each
 *              falling and rising edge at the input pin P02.0. The falling and rising edges are generated
 *              with pin P02.1. If an Interrupt occurs, an LED will be toggled.
