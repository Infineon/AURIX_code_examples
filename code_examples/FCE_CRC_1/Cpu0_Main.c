 /*\title FCE CRC calculation
 * \abstract The FCE module is used to calculate the CRC of the same message with different algorithms.
 * \description This training shows how to configure the FCE to calculate CRC of a known message
 *              with all supported algorithms (CRC32, CRC16 and CRC8).
 *              The FCE interrupt is enabled to report execution errors.
 *              Any CRC kernel calculation error is indicated by switching ON the related LED.
 *
 * \name FCE_CRC_1
 * \version V1.0.0
 * \board APPLICATION KIT TC2X7 V1.1, KIT_AURIX_TC297_TFT_BC-Step, TC29xTA/TX_BC-step
