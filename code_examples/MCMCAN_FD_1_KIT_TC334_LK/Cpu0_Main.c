 /*\title MCMCAN FD data transmission
 * \abstract MCMCAN in Flexible Data-Rate mode is used to exchange data between two nodes, implemented in the same device using Loop-Back mode.
 * \description The CAN messages are sent from CAN node 0 to CAN node 1 using Loop-Back mode. Both CAN nodes are set
 *              to CAN Flexible Data-rate mode (CAN FD). After each CAN message transmission and successful reception,
 *              an interrupt is generated. Inside the interrupt service routine, the content of the received CAN
 *              message is read. In case of the successful read operation, the received data is compared to the
 *              transmitted data. If all messages are received without any error detected, the LED is turned on to
 *              confirm successful message reception.
