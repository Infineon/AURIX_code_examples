 /*\title BMETAL_TC375_ADS_WSS_GTM_TSSM_HW
 * \abstract This is a demo code for interfacing the TLE5046iC Wheel Speed Sensor (WSS) using GTM block, the AK protocol is decoded by the GTM-TIM using TSSM mode of operation
 * \description The TIM block within the GTM is used to decode the AK protocol. The are five TIM channels used in this example, three of them perform the manchester decoding, the fourth is used to measure the period of the speed pulse signal and the fifth is used to count the number of bits transmitted in the AK frame for handling the shorten frame.
 * \name BMETAL_TC375_ADS_WSS_GTM_TSSM_HW
 * \version V1.0.2
 * \board AURIX TC375 lite Kit, KIT_A2G_TC375_LITE, TC37xTP_A-Step
 * \keywords GTM, TIM, TSSM, WSS
