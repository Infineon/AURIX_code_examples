# BMETAL_TC375_ADS_WSS_GTM_TSSM_HW 
**This is a demo code for interfacing the TLE5046iC Wheel Speed Sensor (WSS) using GTM block, the AK protocol is decoded by the GTM-TIM using TSSM mode of operation**

## Device  
The device used in this example is AURIX&trade; TC37xTP_A-Step  

## AK protocol  

The WSS modulates periodic current pulses of different magnitudes for speed pulse (14 to 28mA) and data (7mA to 14mA), a sample frame is like below. The width of the speed pulse and the AK data period is 50Âµs typically. The AK data is manchester coded, the rising and falling edge at the middle of the period corresponds to bits 1 and 0 respectively.

## Scope of work 

The TIM block within the GTM is used to decode the AK protocol. The are five TIM channels used in this example, three of them perform the manchester decoding, the fourth is used to measure the period of the speed pulse signal and the fifth is used to count the number of bits transmitted in the AK frame for handling the shorten frame.


## Introduction  
The Generic Timer Module (GTM) is a modular timer unit designed to accommodate many timer applications.

The Timer Input Module (TIM) is responsible for filtering and capturing input signals of the GTM. Several characteristics of the input signals can be measured inside the TIM channels. 

The ARU connected Timer Output Module (ATOM), which is part of the GTM, is able to generate complex output signals without CPU interactions.

The Clock Management Unit (CMU) is responsible for clock generation of the GTM. The Configurable Clock Generation Subunit (CFGU) provides eight clock sources for the GTM submodules TIM, TBU, MON and ATOM.

The implementation block diagram is as shown below. 'Serial Data In' is the manchester encoded signal from the sensor, 'Serial Data Out' and 'Serial Clock Out' are the output generated by the GTM TIM modules. 'Serial Data Out' is inverted sample and hold version of 'Serial Data In', the sample point is chosen based on the 'Serial Clock Out' (3/4 of the bit period from falling edge). 'Serial Clock Out' is XORed signal of 'Serial Data In' and 'Serial Data Out'. Finally, 'Serial Data Out' sampled at the falling edge of 'Serial Clock Out' which provides the manchester decoded data.

CPU configures and enables the GTM module and configures TIM channels are used to decode the AK protocol. 'Serial Data In' is sensor output and is provided as input to TIM1_CH0 and TIM1_CH2. TIM1_CH0 operates in TSSM mode and is used to generate the sample and hold signal, shift clock is TDU_SAMPLE_EVT (two events are generated for sample and hold). TIM1_CH1 is used to delay the sampling event at 3/4 of period using TDU, also it inverts the F_OUT from TIM1_CH0 using it's LUT. TIM1_CH2 is used to decode the AK data using the TSSM mode, 'Serial Data In' and 'Serial Data Out' are XORed using it's LUT which is 'Serial Clock Out'. Falling edge of 'Serial Clock Out' is used for sample clock. TIM1_CH3 is used to measure the period of the speed pulse signal. TIM1_CH4 is used to find the number of bits transmitted in the AK frame. In the interrupt handler of the TIM1_CH3, CPU can read the period of the speed pulse signal and the decode AK data frame.

'Serial Data In'   - TIM_IN of TIM1_CH0 and TIM1_CH2

'Serial Data Out'  - F_OUT of TIM1_CH1

'Serial Clock Out' - F_OUT of TIM1_CH2

'Speed Pulse'      - TIM_IN of TIM1_CH3 and TIM1_CH4

Note: There are three modes of operation controlled by the macros *WSS_EMULATION* and *USE_FCADC*

* With Real WSS and internal FCADC:  when *WSS_EMULATION* is FALSE and *USE_FCADC* is TRUE

* With Real WSS and external comparators:  when *WSS_EMULATION* is FALSE and *USE_FCADC* is FALSE

* WSS Emulation: when *WSS_EMULATION* is TRUE and *USE_FCADC* is FALSE

## Hardware setup  

The board used for testing is the AURIX&trade; TC375_LITE(KIT_A2G_TC375_LITE)
 
<img src="./Images/TC375 LK.png" width="600" /> 

For the emulation mode, litekit, USB cable and connecting wires are sufficient. For the real WSS, additional WSS sensor board with external comparator(*USE_FCADC* is FALSE) is required.

## Implementation 

**[CPU] WSS_Configurations.h**

There are different modes of operation which is controlled by the *WSS_EMULATION* and *USE_FCADC* macros in *WSS_Configurations.h* file. By default, the emulation is not enabled and isolation of the speed pulse and AK data signal is done through internal FCADC.

 * *WSS_EMULATION* needs to be FALSE when using real sensor, to be TRUE only when there is no WSS and the speed pulse and data signals needs to be emulated
 * *USE_FCADC* needs to be FALSE when external comparator is used to isolate the speed pulse and the data signals or when *WSS_EMULATION* is TRUE. *USE_FCADC* to be TRUE when the user intends to use internal FCADC.
 * *BIT_1_T* needs to be configured based on the pulse width of the speed pulse BIT_1_T = tp/2. Other bit durations are derived based on this.
 * *EMULATION_DATA* to be configured with EMULATION_DATA1/EMULATION_DATA2/EMULATION_DATA3
 * *SPEED_PERIOD* is used as period of the speed pulse for emulation purpose
 * *TDU_COUNTER* is used to create delay of 3/4th of bit period in the TIM1_CH1's TDU
 * *SPEED_PULSE_THRESHOLD* and *DATA_THRESHOLD* are used to set the reference values of the FCADCs
 * *NUM_OF_POLES* specifies the number of magnetic poles in the ring sensor
 * *TIM_RESOLUTION* specifies the resolution in seconds based on the TIM1_CH3 clock selection

This signal to be connected to AN16 and P00.11 pins of the TC375 corresponding to the FCADC0 and FCADC3, the ground of the WSS and the lite kit to be connected as well. The boundary flags FCADC0 and FCADC3 are internally routed to TIM1_CH0 and TIM1_CH3 inputs, the boundary flag of FCADC0 is also connected to CBFLOUT2 and then routed to TIM1_CH2 so TIM1_CH0 and TIM1_CH2 has AK data input.

## Further Notes

- The demo is only provided as a reference for implementing AK protocol for evaluation. There is no qualification attached to it, it is responsibility of the integrator.
- In this implementation, the data is decoded on the rising edge of the speed pulse. Due to this for the last speedpulse, the captured data is not available and the data received at the next speed pulse is not valid. The user can handle this step in the application if needed to correctly decode the last data.
- This implementation doesnât validate the pulse width of the speed pulse and the data signals; it can be done by the application if required.
- The period, duty cycle and the start offset (for synchronization) are fixed in the example and can be modified and if need recalibration could be done at runtime. As the TIM1_CH3 operates in TPWM, and the width of the speed pulse is captured in TIM1_CH3_GPR0 which can used for this compensation.
- It is assumed the TC375 device is up before the WSS starts sending the AK frames.
