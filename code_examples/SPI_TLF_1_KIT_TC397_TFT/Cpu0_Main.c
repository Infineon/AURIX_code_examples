 /*\title QSPI communication with TLF35584
 * \abstract A QSPI module configured as SPI master communicates with the TLF35584 device via SPI protocol.
 * \description QSPI2 is configured in master mode and used to send data frames to TLF35584 device via SPI protocol.
 *              The TLF35584 device is set to the NORMAL state and, in case of success, the LED D104 is turned on.
 *              This training focuses on the SPI communication between QSPI module and TLF35548 device.
 *              Typical application use case and the features of the TLF35584 device are not covered by this training.
