 /*\title Emergency Stop via SCU
 * \abstract This example shows how to trigger an emergency stop via an external signal and how port pins can be set to a defined state in this case.
 * \description The LED D107, which is driven by the port pin P13.0, is blinking until an external signal 
 *              triggers an emergency stop and sets the pin to emergency stop mode.
