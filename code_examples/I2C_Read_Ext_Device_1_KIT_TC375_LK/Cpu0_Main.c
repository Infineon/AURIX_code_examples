 /*\title Read external device MAC address via I2C
 * \abstract An I2C module configured as I2C master is used to read a register of an external device.
 * \description An I2C module configured as I2C master is used to read the MAC address stored in MCP79411,
 *              a Real-Time-Clock device mounted on the board KIT_AURIX_TC297_TFT_BC-Step. The AURIX
 *              device reads the MAC address through the I2C module and stores it into a global variable.
