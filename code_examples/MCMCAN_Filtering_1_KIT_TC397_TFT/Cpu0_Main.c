 /*\title MCMCAN acceptance filtering
 * \abstract The initialization and configuration of several filter modes are used to illustrate different acceptance filtering options.
 * \description The CAN messages are sent from CAN node 0 to CAN node 1 using Loop-Back mode.
 *              Each transmitted CAN message contains a different message ID and based on the filter configuration,
 *              the message is either accepted or rejected by CAN node 1. Messages that passed acceptance filtering
 *              are stored in RX FIFOs 0 and 1 or dedicated RX buffer based on the filter configuration. Upon storing
 *              the messages, the interrupt service routine is called and the content of the received CAN message is
 *              read. Once the content of all the received messages is read, the received data is compared to the
 *              transmitted data. If all messages are received without any error detected, an LED is turned on to
 *              confirm successful message reception.
