 /*\title EGTM TOM PWM generation
 * \abstract EGTM TOM is used to generate a PWM signal, which is driving the intensity of an LED.
 * \description The LED 1 is driven by pin 9 of the port 3. The state of the pin is controlled by the PWM signal generated
 *              by the Enhanced Generic Timer Module (EGTM) in-built Timer Output Module (TOM).
