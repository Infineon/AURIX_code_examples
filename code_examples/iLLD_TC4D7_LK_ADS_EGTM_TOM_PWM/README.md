# iLLD_TC4D7_LK_ADS_EGTM_TOM_PWM

**EGTM TOM is used to generate a PWM signal, which is driving the intensity of an LED.**  

## Device  
The device used in this example is AURIX&trade; TC4D7XP_A-Step_CC_COM

## Board  
The board used for testing is the AURIX&trade; TC4D7XP_A-Step_CC_COM (KIT_A3G_TC4D7_LITE)

## Scope of work  
The LED 1 is driven by pin 9 of the port 3. The state of the pin is controlled by the PWM signal generated by the Enhanced Generic Timer Module (EGTM) in-built Timer Output Module (TOM).


## Introduction  
The EGTM is a modular timer unit designed to accommodate many timer applications.

The EGTM module is capable of driving different kinds of pulse-width-modulation (PWM) with and without dead-time. It is optimized for electrical drive applications.

It has an in-built Timer Output Module (TOM) that can offer up to 16 independent channels to generate output signals.

The Clock Management Unit (CMU) is responsible for clock generation of the EGTM. The Fixed Clock Generation (FXU) is one of its subunits and it provides five predefined non-configurable clocks for EGTM modules, including the TOM.



## Hardware setup  
This code example has been developed for the board KIT_TC4D7 Lite KIT (AURIX&trade; TC4D7 Lite KIT Board)

## Implementation  
**Configuring the TOM** 
 
The configuration of the TOM is done by calling the initialization function *initEgtmTomPwm()* containing the following steps:

- Enable the EGTM by calling the function *IfxEgtm_enable()*

- Enable the FXCLK clocks by calling the function *IfxEgtm_Cmu_enableClocks()*

- The function *IfxEgtm_Tom_Pwm_initConfig()* initializes an instance of the structure *IfxEgtm_Tom_Pwm_Config* with its default values

- The *IfxEgtm_Tom_Pwm_Config* structure can be modified to set the following parameters to initialize the module:
    - *cluster* – Selection of the EGTM cluster (Cluster 2 (TOM2) in this example) 
    - *tomChannel* – Selection of the channel which is driving the LED (Channel 12 in this example)
    - *period* – Setting of the period for the PWM signal to the desired value
    - *pin.outputPin* – Selection of the LED as output pin
    - *synchronousUpdateEnabled* – Enabling of synchronous update of the timer
    - *clock* - Selection of the clock source for the TOM channel
- After configuration, the function *IfxEgtm_Tom_Pwm_init()* initializes and activates the TOM with the user configuration

- Start the PWM with the function *IfxEgtm_Tom_Pwm_start()*


**Setting the duty cycle**

The setting of the duty cycle is done by calling the function *setDutyCycle()*, which contains the following steps:
- Set the *dutyCycle* parameters of the configuration structure to set the duty cycle of the PWM signal to the desired value
- Call the function *IfxEgtm_Tom_Pwm_init()* to reconfigure the TOM with the new value of the duty cycle

All the functions used for the configuration of the TOM are provided by the iLLD header *IfxEgtm_Tom_Pwm.h*.

**Fading the LED**

The fading of the LED is done in the function *fadeLED()* by repeatedly adding or removing a step value to the duty cycle of the PWM.

**Calculation example**

The CMU clock 1 frequency (ffxclk1) is set to 200 MHz / 16 in this example. The period value to have the desired PWM frequency (fpwm) is calculated with the following formula:  

    Period = ffxclk1 / fpwm

In this example:  
    
    Period = 200 MHz / 16 / 2 kHz = 6250 ticks

## Compiling and programming

Before testing this code example:  
- Power the board through the dedicated power connector 
- Connect the board to the PC through the USB interface
- Build the project using the dedicated Build button <img src="./Images/build_activeproj.gif" /> or by right-clicking the project name and selecting "Build Project"
- To flash the device and immediately run the program, click on the dedicated Flash button <img src="./Images/micro.png" /> 

## Run and Test   
After code compilation and flashing the device, observe the LED 1 (P03.9), which starts fading.
