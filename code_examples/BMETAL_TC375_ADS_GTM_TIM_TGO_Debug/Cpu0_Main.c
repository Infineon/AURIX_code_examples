 /*\title GTM to TGO signal routing
 * \abstract This example demonstrates how the GTM signals can be routed to OCDS trigger output pins TGO.
 * \description Two ATOM channels are used to generate two PWM signals and these signals are XORed using the LUT of the TIM channel. The filtered output of the TIM channel is routed to the TGO (Trigger Output) pin. This is intended only for debug purpose as it uses OCDS module.
