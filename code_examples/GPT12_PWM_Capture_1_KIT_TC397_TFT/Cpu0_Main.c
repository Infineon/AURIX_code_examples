 /*\title Capture of PWM signal via GPT12
 * \abstract The GPT12 unit is used to capture an external PWM signal and calculate the PWM frequency.
 * \description GPT12 timers are configured in capture mode. The data from the captured PWM signal is used to calculate
 *              the PWM frequency in software. The frequency is then stored in a variable.
 *
 * \name GPT12_PWM_Capture_1_KIT_TC397_TFT
 * \version V2.0.0
