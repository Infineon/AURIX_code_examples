 /*\title DMA transfer of ADC conversion results
 * \abstract The DMA is used to transfer ADC measurements results to LMURAM.
 * \description At the end of an analog-to-digital conversion of the VADC module, an interrupt is triggered, which starts
 *              the data transfer of the converted ADC results via DMA to the LMURAM. The ADC conversion is started
 *              manually via a command of a serial monitor.
 *

 * \version V1.0.0
 * \board APPLICATION KIT TC2X7 V1.1, KIT_AURIX_TC297_TFT_BC-Step, TC29xTA/TX_BC-step
