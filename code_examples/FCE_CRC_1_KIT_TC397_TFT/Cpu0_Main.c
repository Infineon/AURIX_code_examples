 /*\title FCE CRC calculation
 * \abstract The FCE module is used to calculate the CRC of a message with a CRC32 algorithm.
 * \description This training shows how to configure the FCE to calculate CRC of a known message
 *              with a CRC32 algorithm.
 *              The FCE interrupt is enabled to report execution errors.
 *              Any CRC kernel calculation error is indicated by switching ON an LED.
