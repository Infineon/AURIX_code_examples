 /*\title iLLD_TC375_ADS_REDUNDANT_ADC_STM_SMU
 * \abstract A VADC and a DSADC channel read analog values out of the embedded potentiometer. When the mean value of the difference bewteen the two ADCs samples is over a certain threshold, an alarm is activated
 * \description This project uses a EVADC channel and a DSADC channel to periodically sense the voltage at the output of a potentiometer, using STM (System Timer) to trigger the conversions. The difference between the two voltages is then saved in an array where the mean value is calculated. Whenever the mean value of the differences array is over a certain treshold an alarm is activated and an interrupt is triggered as reaction from SMU (Safety Management Unit). The interrupt routine in turn activates one of the LEDs on the board. The voltages sensed by the ADCs are also printed into the Console using UART.
