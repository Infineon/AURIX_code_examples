 /*\title BMETAL_TC377_ADS_EVADC_Master_Slave_1
 * \abstract TC3xx EVADC master-slave synchronous conversion and Alias feature
 * \description This example demonstrates how to properly configure multiple EVADC groups (up to 4, within the same synchronization group) for master-slave synchronous conversion. In addition, Alias feature (channel redirection) is explained, too.
 *              
 *              The master will trigger the same channel(s) on the slave(s) at the same time. If other channel is expected, "Alias feature" will help.
