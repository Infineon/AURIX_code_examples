 /*\title Trap error recognition and reaction
 * \abstract This example shows how to identify the root cause of a trap.
 * \description The tutorial describes what types of traps are supported by the AURIX (TM)
 *              microcontroller, their root causes and how to identify them. AURIX (TM)
 *              architecture supports different types of traps. Three different traps can be
 *              provoked with this example and the tutorial guides the user through the
 *              needed steps to observe the root cause of each trap.
