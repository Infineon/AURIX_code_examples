 /*\title Power Saving in Standby Mode
 * \abstract Set the system to standby mode and use an external trigger signal on PinA to return to active mode.
 * \description This example shows how to set the microcontroller in power saving mode standby. The standby mode
 *              is triggered via a SW request by writing into the Power Management Control and Status Register. The
 *              system is woken up from standby mode using PinA (port pin 14.1) and can be controlled by a terminal
 *              program.
