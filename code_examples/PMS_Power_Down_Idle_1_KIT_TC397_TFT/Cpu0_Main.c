 /*\title Power saving in CPU idle mode
 * \abstract CPU0 switches periodically between run mode and idle mode triggered by STM timer
 * \description The Power Management System (PMS) allows activation of power down modes for each CPU individually
 *              in case there are no active tasks to perform and power consumption needs to be reduced.
 *              In this example, the System Timer periodically generates interrupts (every two seconds). In the
 *              Interrupt Service Routine, the CPU0 is switched between idle mode and run mode. CPU0 toggles LED D110
 *              during run mode whereas the LED D110 remains in the last toggling state while CPU0 is idling.
