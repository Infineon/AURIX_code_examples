 /*\title System time via STM
 * \abstract The STM module is used to get the current system time (days:hours:minutes:seconds). The time is stored in a structure.
 * \description The System Timer (STM) module counts the number of ticks since the last Application Reset.
 *              This number is used to calculate the current system time in day, hours, minutes and seconds.
