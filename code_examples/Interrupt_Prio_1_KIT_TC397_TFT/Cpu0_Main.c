 /*\title Interrupts prioritization
 * \abstract Three interrupts with different priorities are used to toggle LEDs.
 * \description Each interrupt is configured to control the state of one LED.
 *              Based on their priority, the interrupts toggle the appropriate LED.
 *              In this example, the interrupts are triggered by GPT12 module.
