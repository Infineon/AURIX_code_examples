 /*\title Interrupt Priority
 * \abstract Three interrupts with different priorities are used to toggle available two LEDs and incrementing respective ISRs counters.
 * \description On Core 0, two STM interrupts are configured to control the state of two LEDs (P03.9 & P03.10) along with incrementing respective ISRs counters and third interrupt is being generated by Core1 STM to Core 0 which only incrementing respective ISR counter. Based on their priority, the interrupts toggle the appropriate LED and increment counters. In this example, the interrupts are triggered by STM module.
