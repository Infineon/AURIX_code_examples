 /*\title Interrupt generation via STM trigger
 * \abstract The STM is configured to trigger an interrupt every 500 ms. The interrupt toggles an LED.
 * \description The System Timer (STM) module counts up to a configured compare value, when it reaches the specific
 *              value, it triggers an interrupt and resets its counter value. The value is set to trigger the interrupt
 *              every 500 ms; at each interrupt an LED is toggled.
