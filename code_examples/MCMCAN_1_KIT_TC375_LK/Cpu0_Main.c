 /*\title MCMCAN data transmission
 * \abstract MCMCAN is used to exchange data between two nodes, implemented in the same device using Loop-Back mode.
 * \description A CAN message is sent from CAN node 0 to CAN node 1 using Loop-Back mode. After the CAN message
 *              transmission, an interrupt is generated and an LED is turned on to confirm successful message
 *              transmission. Once the CAN message is successfully received by the CAN node 1, an interrupt is
 *              generated. Inside the interrupt service routine the content of the received CAN message is compared to
 *              the content of the transmitted CAN message. In case of a success, another LED is turned on to confirm
 *              successful message reception.
