 /*\title DMA Linked List Mode usage
 * \abstract DMA Linked Lists are used to execute a series of DMA transactions without CPU intervention.
 * \description In this example, four DMA transactions are configured in DMA Linked List mode.
 *              Triggering one DMA transaction leads to the execution of all DMA transactions consecutively.
 *              An interrupt is triggered at the completion of the last DMA transaction.
 *              If DMA has correctly transferred the data, the LED 1 driven by port pin 03.9 toggles and a new cycle
 *              starts again. Otherwise, the LED 2 driven by port pin 03.10 turns ON and no more DMA transfers are done.
