 /*\title Clock configuration via SCU
 * \abstract The clock system is configured based on a PLL frequency of 200 MHz and the clock signal is provided at an external port pin.
 * \description The Clock Control Unit, which is part of the System Control Units (SCU), is used to configure
 *              the PLL clock. This clock signal is routed to an external clock output pin, which can be observed
 *              with an oscilloscope.
