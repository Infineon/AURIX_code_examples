 /*\title TMADC CDSP Filtering with Interrupts
 * \abstract The CDSP filters out high frequency components of the signal sampled by TMADC
 * \description An amplitude modulated sine wave is fed to the Time-Multiplexed ADC (TMADC) as input.
 *              The Converter Digital Signal Processor (CDSP) as a FIR filter removes high frequency harmonics from the
 *              TMADC output signal. TMADC output is fed as input to the CDSP. During their respective service request
 *              events, the CDSP and TMADC outputs are stored in an array and traced.
